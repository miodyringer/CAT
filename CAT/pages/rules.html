            <h2><span class="icon">🃏</span> Cards</h2>
            <p>
                Normal Cards (blue background) are used to move a cat forward along the track, the value printed on the card determines the range.
                Special Cards (red background) provide unique abilities, they are needed to start the game and can bring a strategic situation to the game.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="icon">🎮</span> Gameplay & Movement Rules</h2>


            <h3> Basic Movement and Board Spaces </h3>
            <p>
                Each space on the track can only be occupied by one cat at a time.
                Cats are moved clockwise around the board.
                If a move ends by landing on a tile occupied by an enemy cat, then the enemy cat is going to get kicked into the designated starting area again.
            </p>
            <h3> The Start Tile </h3>
            <p>
                A cat that is occupying its own colored start tile is in a safe zone.
                The cat is immune and cannot be captured, swapped or burned.
                Furthermore, the cat cannot be passed over by any other cat. It serves as a solid wall, no cat can pass it until it is moved. To move into your finishing zone your starting tile can't be blocked because you move over this tile.
            </p>
            <h3> Entering and Moving in the Finishing Zone </h3>
            <p>
                Cats inside the finishing zone cannot be jumped over, they create a blockade for any cats behind them. The finishing zone needs to be filled sequentially.
                A cat must enter the finishing zone with an exact value.
                If a cat completes a full lap passing or landing exactly on the entrance to the finishing zone. It must complete another full lap around the board to get another chance.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="icon">🌊</span> Flow of the Game</h2>
            <p>
                The game is played over a series of rounds. At the beginning of each round, every player receives a number of cards that change each round in a descending cycle. Starting with 6 cards, descending to 2 cards. After the round with 2 cards, the cycle resets and the next round starts again with 6 cards.
                The game proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must perform the following actions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select one card from your hand.</li>
                <li>Play the card, moving one of your cats according to the value or special effect.</li>
                <li>If you are unable to make any legal move with the cards in your hand, you drop all your cards and are skipped until the next round starts.</li>
                <li>When all players had their cards laid down, the round is over and the next one begins until a winner is determined.</li>
            </ul>
