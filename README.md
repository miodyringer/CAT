# üìú CAT - The Game

CAT is a strategic digital board game based on the classic German game "Dog". In this competitive race, each player must cleverly use a hand of cards to move their team of cats from their starting base, around the entire board, and into the safety of their finishing zone.

The game is not just about moving forward; success depends on managing a hand of cards with unique abilities. Players can use special cards to swap places with opponents, burn enemy cats off the board, or even move backward to gain a tactical advantage. Planning your moves, blocking opponents, and knowing when to play the right card are key to victory.
